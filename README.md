## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- Vite for development and build process
- GitHub Pages for deployment

### What I learned

While working on this project, I strengthened my skills in creating responsive layouts with Flexbox and handling element visibility using the display property in CSS. This project also provided an opportunity to experiment with TypeScript in a frontend context, which helped me write more structured and error-resistant code.

### Continued development

I plan to explore advanced SASS features to enhance the maintainability and scalability of my stylesheets. I also intend to further integrate TypeScript in future frontend projects to reinforce type safety and streamline debugging.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks: Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide was instrumental in implementing the flexible layout of the component.
- [MDN Web Docs: CSS Display Property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) - Helped me with controlling element visibility.
- [Frontend Mentor Community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community) - Engaging with other developers in the community provided insights and useful tips for handling responsive layouts.
